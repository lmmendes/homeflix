| VARIABLE           | TYPE    | Description                                            |
|--------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| PUID               | integer | User ID                                                |
| PGID               | integer | Group ID                                               |
| STORAGE_FOLDER     | String  | Local folder were the media files will be stored.      |
| APPS_CONFIG_FOLDER | String  | Local folder were the apps config files will be stored |
| PLEX_CLAIM         | String  | Plex Claim Code, https://www.plex.tv/claim/            |

## Configuration `PUID` and `PGID`

> id $user
> uid=501(mike) gid=20(staff) groups=20(staff),12(everyone)...

Here we can see that `id $user` returned `uid=501(mike)` and `gid=20(staff) groups=20(staff)...`

For the `PUID` use the number `501` from the `uid=501(mike)` and for `PGID` use any of the numbers from `gid=20(staff)` or `groups=20(staff)` for this let's use `20`.

This means the the content on the `.env` file should look a bit like this:

```bash
PUID=501
PGID=20
```

## Configuration `STORAGE_FOLDER`

## Configuration `PLEX_CLAIM`
